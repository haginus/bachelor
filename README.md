# Bachelor frontend

This is my bachelor project, a web platform made specially for the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Bucharest. It features a way for students to find the coordinating teachers that will help them write the end of study paper. It also allows students and teachers to upload the sign up documents, including the generation of some of these documents. Evaluation committees can then grade the papers and generate the committee catalogs.

This is the frontend app, made with Angular 11.

[Check out the backend app here](https://github.com/haginus/bachelor-backend)

## Development server
Configure the `src/environments` files by including the backend api URL.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
